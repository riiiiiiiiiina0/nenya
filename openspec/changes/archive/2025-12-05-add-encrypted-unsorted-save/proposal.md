# Change: Encrypt current page URL & save to Unsorted

## Why
Users want a quick way to stash the current page into Raindrop Unsorted while optionally hiding the URL behind a password-protected redirect generated by the oh-auth service.

## What Changes
- Add entry points (pinned shortcut, Chrome command, and context menu) that launch an encrypt-and-save flow for the active page or right-click target.
- Prompt for a password; when blank/cancelled, fall back to the existing Unsorted save for the target URL; when provided, POST `{url, password}` to `https://oh-auth.vercel.app/secret/encrypt` and use the returned decrypt URL.
- Save the encrypted URL to Raindrop Unsorted with a generated multi-word title, reuse the Unsorted save pipeline without `pleaseParse`, and surface success/error feedback.

## Impact
- Affected specs: encrypted-unsorted-save (new), references save-to-unsorted and pinned-shortcuts.
- Affected code: popup pinned shortcuts config/handler, manifest commands, background context menu + command wiring, encrypt-and-save handler with oh-auth POST client, random-name generator, Unsorted save integration.
